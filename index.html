									<p> As we all know Nestlé is the largest food company in the world, marketing over
8,500 brands and 30,000 products. It operates nearly 500 factories
across 5 continents and employs over 200,000 employees
worldwide. As the World Food Company, Nestlé is the provider of
the best food for whatever time of day and for whatever time of your
life. Nestlé R&D Australia plays an important role in the
development of products for Nestlé Nutrition, with focus on creating
products with micronutrient fortification to address deficiencies. The company wants to expand its business by adding new product
lines. However, the Head of Growth and Strategy suggested that it
was important to know the performance of the current products. We were conatcted and asked to develop a
product comparison dashboard to help the company take a
decision on its expansion plans. At the end of the analysis we were able to generate key insight to help the head of growth make informed 
deciosion, which lead to increase in sales by 30%. By means of highlighting the location with the 
highest and lowest sales, comapring different products based on maximum and minimum revenue generated. And a lot more interesting key insights.
This analysis was carried out using POWERBI</p>

									</a></h2>
									<p> Reedox airline management got in contact with us because they do not have much financial or data analytics experience. Many of their systems are
										disparate and not connected. I was shocked to find out
										that until just recently, the airline could not pull specific
										aircraft details, such as route and seating capacity, from a
										single report, but rather needed to open two or more files
										and compare the information. After the analysis we were able to present key insights to drive the business growth and
										position in the industry</p>
